<ul>
  <li> <h3> Question Quail </h3> </li>
    Like Apples to Apples but with freeform questions and answers, Question
    Quail is a multiplayer question game developed with a small group for Web Development
    at Tufts University in the fall of 2016. </br>
    I worked primarily on front end and integrating database requests, and worked
    some with the MongoDB database on the back end as well. <br>

    <li>
      <h3> EyeDraw </h3></li>
      EyeDraw uses the open source WebGazer eye tracking program to create 
      a drawing application that draws based on where you look on the screen. <br>

      I worked in a team of two to develop this small project for a Tufts
      OOP/GUI class; I worked full stack on this project
      <br>
